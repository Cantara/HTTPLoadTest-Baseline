# HTTPLoadTest-baseline

A simple baseline for building LoadTests to be used for continous deploy/continous production QA pipelines.  Baseline projects are meant to be a git clone starting 
point for for software which are expected to grow and flourish in different ways which are not easy to parameterize in early stages. It should be usable for quite 
a few settings, but is expected to grow in different directions. We would love to receive pull-request for enhancements both on current codebase and extensibillity features.

# Pipeline usage example

```
wget -post-data "jsonConfig=@loadTestReadSpecification.json http://localhost:28086/HTTPLoadTest-baseline/loadTest/read"
wget -post-data "jsonConfig=@loadTestWriteSpecification.json http://localhost:28086/HTTPLoadTest-baseline/loadTest/write"
wget -post-data "jsonConfig=@loadTestConfig.json http://localhost:28086/HTTPLoadTest-baseline/loadTest"
##  wait and get the result
sleep 40s
wget -o result.txt http://localhost:8086/HTTPLoadTest-baseline/loadTest/status
## check the results.txt against QA rules
```

### Example LoadTestConfig
```json
{
  "test_id": "MyTestID",
  "test_name": "An example of load test configuration",
  "test_no_of_threads": 10,
  "test_read_write_ratio": 90,
  "test_sleep_in_ms": 10,
  "test_randomize_sleeptime": true,
  "test_duration_in_seconds": 20
}
```

The LoadTestConfig is the configuration of the top-level parameters of a load test and control the behaviour of the two (read/write) TestSpesifications
(see further down for more information and examples of how to configure TestSpecifications). The LoadTestConfig also consist of the load-time, which is 
the longest allowed time the tests are allowed to run.
 


## Example on load test result
```text
Started: 02/01-2018  14:42:50  Now: 02/01-2018  14:43:02  Running for 117 seconds.

  203 read tests resulted in 202 successful runs where 1 was marked as deviation(s).
   22 write tests resulted in 22 successful runs where 0 was marked as deviation(s).
    0 unmarked tests resulted in 0 successful runs where 0 was marked as deviation(s).
  225 total tests resulted in 224 successful runs where 1 was marked as deviation(s).
```

If we look at the example output above, we see that we have a load-test with a read/write ratio of 90, 
which mean that we have almost 10 times more runs of the read TestConfiguration than we have invocations of the write TestSpecification. 
In this run, we have recorded one failed read run, which was a result of a timeout. (If we got non 2xx HTTP codes, the result would be failed test.)


### Example on test invocation result
```json
{
  "test_id" : "r-MyTestID",
  "test_name" : "An example of load test configuration",
  "test_tags" : "URL: http://bing.com/",
  "test_run_no" : 43,
  "test_duration" : 429,
  "test_success" : true,
  "test_deviation_flag" : true,
  "test_timestamp" : 1514878656855
}
```

This example show that we have received an HTTP 2xx code, but something unexpected happened and the response was marked as an deviation. The most 
common cause of deviations in HTTPLoadTest is timeout, as we use an underlaying icuit-breaker framework called hystrix to avoid blocking and dangeling 
HTTP requests and internal threads.



## Example on read test specification
```json
[ {
  "command_url" : "https://gmail.com",
  "command_contenttype" : "text/html",
  "command_http_post" : false,
  "command_timeout_milliseconds" : 5000,
  "command_template" : "",
  "command_replacement_map" : {
    "#Passord" : "TestPassord",
    "#BrukerID" : "TestBruker"
  }
  },
  {
  "command_url" : "http://test.tull.no/#MySite",
  "command_contenttype" : "application/json",
  "command_http_authstring": "Basic ZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtbWVkaWNhdGlvbjoxT09jTEpoR01oSyMxMHUhRDMzUw==",
  "command_http_post" : true,
  "command_timeout_milliseconds" : 5000,
  "command_template" : "{\n  \\\"sub\\\": \\\"#fizzle(digits:67643)\\\",\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"#BrukerID\\\",\n  \\\"admin\\\": true\n}",
  "command_replacement_map" : {
    "#Passord" : "TestPassord",
    "#BrukerID" : "TestBruker",
    "#MySite" : "demo"
  },
   "command_response_map" : {
     "#randomizeName" : "$..test_randomize_sleeptime",
      "#testName" : "$..test_name"
  }
} ]
```
From the example above, we can see use of several of HTTPLoadTest features. The command_replacement_map is a supplied variable-set for the given command. This is used
to replace parts of an URL or parts of an HTTP payload. The command_response_map consist of JsonPath expression which is matched against the response and put into the
corresponding named variable. These gererated variables can then be used in consequitive commands alond with the variables in the command_replacement_map. If you need 
a list as a result, you might find the #fizzle(option:#testName) feature handy. This will pick a random value from the returned response and substitute it in the next
command.  As of now, only simple, pre-calculated http badic-auth is supported.









#### Template special operations

```
#fizzle(chars:replaceMe)                          =>  tEftohTdS
#fizzle(digits:67643)                             =>  32632
#fizzle(U_chars:(TEST)                            =>  WRVY
#fizzle(L_chars:(lower)                           =>  tgewt
#fizzle(HEX:(a hexvalue)                          =>  4E7AD3B084
 #fizzle(option:yes, no, here, there)             =>  here
```

### Example on write test specification
```json

[ {
  "command_url" : "https://gmail.com",
  "command_contenttype" : "text/html",
  "command_http_post" : false,
  "command_timeout_milliseconds" : 5000,
  "command_template" : "",
  "command_replacement_map" : {
    "#Passord" : "TestPassord",
    "#BrukerID" : "TestBruker"
  }
}, {
  "command_url" : "http://test.tull.no",
  "command_contenttype" : "application/json",
  "command_http_post" : true,
  "command_timeout_milliseconds" : 5000,
  "command_template" : "{\n  \\\"sub\\\": \\\"#fizzle(chars:replaceMe)\\\",\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"#BrukerID\\\",\n  \\\"admin\\\": true\n}",
  "command_replacement_map" : {
    "#Passord" : "TestPassord",
    "#BrukerID" : "TestBruker"
  },
   "command_response_map" : {
     "#randomizeName" : "$..test_randomize_sleeptime",
     "#testName" : "$..test_name"
  }
} ]
```


#### If you want to provision several sets of TestSpecifications, you can add something like this to ./config_override/application_override.properties
```properties
TestSpecification.1.read.filename=./specifications/FirstReadTestSpecification.json
TestSpecification.1.write.filename=./specifications/FirstWriteTestSpecification.json
TestSpecification.2.read.filename=./specifications/SecondReadTestSpecification.json
TestSpecification.2.write.filename=./specifications/SecondWriteTestSpecification.json
```
